Iâ€™m a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Michigan where Iâ€™m advised by Alanson Sample and Ronald Dreslinski.</p>

<p>I received a bachelors of science in engineering from the University of Michigan
in 2022 where my coursework comprised of robotics and computer. I enjoy creating novel embedded systems and using machine learning to make sense of the real world phenomena the device observes.</p>

<p>There are currently two themes built on Poole:</p>
