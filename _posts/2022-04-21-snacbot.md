Our project aims to accomplish the task of assisted feeding. For most humans, the task of identifying a piece of food and recognizing the optimal way to pick it up and transfer it to the body is relatively simple. However, for humans with disabilities that prevent them from using their arms, a caregiver is required. SNACBot is a 5 axis robotic arm with a depth-sensing RGB camera that uses computer vision techniques to find, grasp, and deliver food to a human. Results of the project show that a robot arm can be effectively utilized to autonomously feed a human.
