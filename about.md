I'm a second year Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Michigan where I'm advised by [Alanson Sample](https://alansonsample.com/) and [Ronald Dreslinski](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rdreslin/).

I received my B.S.E. in computer engineering from the University of Michigan
in 2022 where my coursework was comprised of robotics and computer vision. Now, I am a researcher in the [Interactive Sensing and Computing lab](https://theisclab.com/) where I create novel embedded systems and use machine learning to make sense of the real world phenomena they observe. My primary focus lies in developing embedded hardware to perform activity recognition with the goal of improving current healthcare sensing approaches.
