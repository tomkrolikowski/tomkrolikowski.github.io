I'm a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Michigan where I'm advised by [Alanson Sample](https://alansonsample.com/) and [Ronald Dreslinski](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rdreslin/).

I received my B.S.E. in computer engineering from the University of Michigan
in 2022 where my coursework was comprised of robotics and computer vision. Now, I am a researcher in the [Interactive Sensing and Computing lab](https://theisclab.com/) where I create novel embedded systems and use machine learning to make sense of the real world phenomena they observe.
